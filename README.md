# Project Documentation - Supplement to the board game Settlers of Catan

## Required Material

You will need the following materials to complete the project:
1. Filament PLA
    - Color: blue, white (You can certainly use different color combination. For the example I chose this one)
    - Link: [HERE YOU CAN BUY IT](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/pearl-blue-pla-filament-1kg/)
    

## Required Technologies
Necessary technologies for production:

1. AirBrush
    - Link: [HERE](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001970547422.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.2cce4d03YQxWmW&algo_pvid=8b3f8e7d-286a-4f1c-9bbf)
    - If you haven't had any previous experience with AirBrush I really recommend watching [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a9xuDa7gfs&t=1178s) (I started here too..) :D

2. 3D Printer (I used Prusa MINI+)

3. Oil Paint Pen Marker

Please note that the provided links are for illustrative purposes only and as a recommendation from me based on my experience with them.
You can search for similar components on other platforms or local electronics stores.

## Workflow
    
1. Begin by 3D printing - Print all available attached materials
    - [Pieces of coastline](Border-Ready/Border_STL) (12x)
    - [Exchange cards]() (9x)
    - [Boxes for playing objects]() (4x)
<img src="" alt="Image" width="300">

You can edit any SLDPRT file to your liking :D
Note! Be careful with adjusting the dimensions of the "Pieces of coastline".

        
2. Then use AirBrush to outline the coast and sea
    - There are no limits to creativity
    <img src="" alt="Image" width="300">
    
3. Use the oil markers to colour the exchange cards
    <img src="" alt="Image" width="300">
    

And you're done, now you can enjoy a great gaming experience!

## Price Calculation

Pricing depends a lot on what equipment you have available, if you don't have anything it's probably not worth investing in an expensive 3D printer, AirBrush etc.

But if you already have the required technology, production will cost you the minimum
- Filament
- Your time
    - 2h Pieces of coastline print
    - 40min Exchange cards print
    - 8h Boxes print
    - 2h Items coloring (of course the time may vary)
